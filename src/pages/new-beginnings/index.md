Hey, Jibin Thomas here. This post is just an introduction about myself.
I'm currently in the final year of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Mumbai University. I have started my personal blog to write about my experience while coding. I'm very passionate about web development and have recently started learning native Android app development in Java. I will mainly be writing about things that I encounter during working on some fun projects.

Check out my [portfolio](https://jibin.tech/) made using Gatsby.js. Also, this blog is also made using Gatsby.js you can grab the template at [Github](https://github.com/jibin2706/gatsby-blog-template)
